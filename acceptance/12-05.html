                          Good evening, panlist!<br/><br/>

                          I find myself a little sad tonight, because this is my last email to you as Publicist.  I've had oodles of fun this past year writing these emails, especially with selecting cool pictures and coming up with silly names for myself!  I ultimately settled on Lightheaded Liger, because ligers are cool and the alliteration seemed to work well.  But like the quote said, all good things have to come to an end.<br/><br/>

                          In the future, our new Publicist Sylvan Zheng will be taking over operations here.  I am excited about this, because Sylvan is a CS major and a good writer, which bodes well for making these things look cool and sound good.  I am now Co-Coordinator, which means that I will be sending way more emails, but, alas, probably not to you.<br/><br/>

                          Okay, to business! We have trips coming up, surprise surprise.  You can go climbing on Saturday at a deeply discounted rate with three of our Leaders.  We're announcing two Winter Break (WinterYO) trips, too.  One at the beginning of break, and one at the end.  And finally, signups for our Wilderness First Responder course are still open, so I included details on that, too.  Read on for more!<br/><br/>

This Saturday we will be heading to City Climb for some top roping, bouldering, and slacklining fun from 2pm to 4pm.

Stuck on campus in between finishing finals and heading away for break? Join us for one last hike on Sleeping Giant! What better way to celebrate finishing the semester than with some fresh air and gorgeous views? Pack a lunch (you can ask the dining hall for one) and we'll head out at 10am and return by 4pm. This will be on the tougher side of hikes, so bring some sturdy boots! Whether it's covered in snow or still sunny, it should be beautiful!

What better finale to your winter break than exploring the beautiful Berkshires in Massachusetts?  Camped out in a Bell Tent -  a type of canvas tent used by the British Army in the 19th century - we will stay at the Beartown State Reservation and do some light hiking or snowshoeing in the area.  We will depart from campus midday on Friday, January 9th and return the afternoon of the 10th, leaving you all of Sunday to mentally prepare for the adventures of a new semester.  The trip is $15 for members and $25 for non-members.  It will be very cold, so make sure to bring plenty of warm layers and appropriate winter gear so that you can stay cozy and dry while wandering in the woods!  Weâ€™ll also do a practice tent sent-up sometime before the end of the semester so that we know what to expect when weâ€™re setting up camp.  Stay tuned for more information about the date for the tent set-up after you sign up for the trip!  Sign up [<a href="www.yaleoutdoors.org/waiver.aspx">here</a>].

Want to know more than just the basics of wilderness medicine?  This winterâ€™s Wilderness First Responder course (WFR) hosted by Yale Outdoors will go beyond elementary first aid skills and give you a wide variety of techniques and tools for staying safe in the woods.  The course will be held at <strong>the Coastal Center at Milford</strong> in Milford, CT from <strong>January 2- January 9</strong>.  Food and lodging will be provided for the duration of the course.  Through Yale Outdoors, tuition for the course is <strong>only $650</strong> as compared to $900 through most other organizations.  Located on the edge of the Long Island Sound with acres of salt marsh, an osprey nest, and a lookout tower, the Coastal Center is a beautiful place to not only learn how to be safe in the wilderness, but also to spend the tail end of your winter break.<br/><br/>
