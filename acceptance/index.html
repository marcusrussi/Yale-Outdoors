<center><h1><strong>Congratulations!</strong></h1></center>

<p><strong>You've been selected to join the ranks of Yale Outdoors as one of our new leaders! We're excited to get to know you better and help you lead some incredible trips around New Haven, the northeast, and the world.</strong>
</p>

<p><i>So, what does this mean?</i></p>
<ul><li>For now, you're what's called a <strong>Pnuckle</strong> (leader in training).</li>
<li>You'll be a Pnuckle until you <strong>attend Pnuckle Retreat on Sat-Sun November 1st-2nd</strong> (more details coming soon) and <strong>co-lead your first trip with a current YO leader</strong>. Once you complete these two requirements, you're a full-fledged leader!</li></ul>

<p><i>What do I need to do?</i></p>
<ul><li><strong>Show up to YO Leaders' Meeting this coming Monday, October 13th from 6pm to 7pm in Davenport Courtyard</strong>. At these weekly dinner meetings, we share our recent outdoor adventures and coordinate trip planning. If you already have budding trip ideas for 2-3 weeks out, don't be shy to bring them with you. Otherwise, come with big ears and watch how YO makes the trip magic happen.</li>
<li><strong>Come to weekly Skills Sessions</strong> offered by current YO leaders every Monday directly following our dinner meeting, from <strong>7pm to 7:30pm</strong>. These sessions are a great way to brush up on rusty skills, or acquire new ones, and we kindly ask that you attend these 7pm-7:30pm Monday Skills Sessions for the rest semester, as a requirement in being a new leader. Skills Sessions this semester may include, but are not limited to: knot tying; stove maintenance; fire kindling; tent set-up; backcountry cooking. If there's a particular skill you would like to learn or think needs refreshing (or you'd like to propose teaching a Skills Session yourself!), please let us know and we'll do our best to craft a Skills Session series that works well for all.</li>
<li>In order to be listed as a leader on the Yale Outdoors website please email a picture and a short bio to Pek (<a href="mailto:shibao.pek@yale.edu">shibao.pek@yale.edu</a>), Rafi (<a href="mailto:rafi.bildner@yale.edu">rafi.bildner@yale.edu</a>) and Alex (<a href="mailto:rafi.bildner@yale.edu">alex.roth@yale.edu</a>) by next <strong>Wednesday, October 15th</strong>. For examples of current leader bios, check out the "Leaders" section of the website.</li></ul>

<p>What if I want to spend even more time with YO?
</p>

<ul><li>We'll enjoy our <strong>first Yale Outdoors Happy [H]Our (YOHO) with you all, our rugged Pnuckles, at 8pm on Saturday October 18th at Rafi, Jake and Alice's house</strong>, <strong>87 Howe Street</strong> - come for baked goods, beer cheer, and stellar company! This'll be your first opportunity to meet the rest of the leader corps in a more relaxed setting, and we hope most of, if not all of you, will be able to attend. More details coming from the social couch soon.</li>
<li><strong>FallYO</strong> is an opportunity to link up with older leaders, get experience in leading a YO trip right off the bat, and knock out your co-leading requirement early on. Naturally, <strong>you'll have priority placement on FallYO as a co-leading Pnuckle</strong>. Email co-coordinators Alex (<a href="mailto:alex.roth@yale.edu">alex.roth@yale.edu</a>) and Rafi (<a href="mailto:rafi.bildner@yale.edu">rafi.bildner@yale.edu</a>) ASAP if you're interested in helping lead one of our FallYO trips.</li>
<li>We're hosting our first <a href="http://soloschools.com/index.cfm?event=course.wfa">SOLO Wilderness First Aid certification</a> course of the year from November 8th to 9th, and YO heavily subsidizes its leaders' tuition fees. Moreover, we'll host a <a href="http://www.soloschools.com/index.cfm?event=course.wfr">SOLO Wilderness First Responder certification</a> course the last week of winter break. While becoming a WFA or WFR isn't a hard-and-fast requirement in being a leader, <strong>having one of these certifications under your belt will not only help you lead safer trips, but will also give you more flexibility in leading generally</strong>. YO policy requires at least one WFA leader on all shorter YO trips, and at least one WFR or WEMT on longer (3 days+) ones. For more details on these courses, contact our wilderness medicine coordinator Emma Spence (<a href="mailto:emma.spence@yale.edu">emma.spence@yale.edu</a>).</li></ul>

<p>Some final thoughts:</p>
<ul><li>We're thrilled and grateful that you all will be joining our wonderful and crunchy family. We know from your thoughtful and passionate applications and interviews that you're just as excited as we are, and we can't wait to get to know you better and start doing cool things outside together</li>
<li>You'll be added to the <strong>leaders' panlist</strong> shortly, as well as to a <strong>GroupMe</strong> with each other, plus YO co-coordinators Alex and Rafi and Pnucklemasters (new leader coordinators) Aaron and Angus.</li>
</ul>
<p>On behalf of the entire leader corps, welcome to the Yale Outdoors leader community. We're elated to have you.
</p>
<p>Cheerful trails, and congrats again,</p>

<p>Alex Roth and Rafi Bildner, Yale Outdoors Co-Coordinators<br/>
Aaron Troncoso and Angus Mossman, Yale Outdoors Pnucklemasters<br/>
and The Yale Outdoors Board</p>
